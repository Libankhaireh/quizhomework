for today assigment we are creating a website that has a code quiuz.
the html file contains the id's that I used to modify the page.
second i created a style.css file to make the website visually appeling in a way that
people with visual difuculty could see it.
then I creatrd a javaScript to modify the index html file.
I create a timer and made it available for the user to see it.
I used Js to create a quiz were if the user enter the wrong answer they will be penalize.
for each wrong answer they loose 1 second.
I set the quiz to be over once all questions are answer or the time is over.
when the time is over the user will be presentrd with a box to let him insert their names
and see their score
